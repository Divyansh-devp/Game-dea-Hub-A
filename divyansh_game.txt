##Game Title

ChronoQuest: Shards of Time

##Concept

ChronoQuest is a story-driven action-adventure game where players travel through different eras of history to restore balance to a fractured timeline. By collecting "Time Shards," players must prevent paradoxes that threaten to unravel reality.

##Gameplay

Players control a time-traveling hero who can explore multiple eras (ancient, medieval, futuristic, etc.), each with unique challenges and enemies. The core loop involves solving puzzles, battling era-specific foes, and making choices that alter the future. The objective is to restore the broken timeline while keeping paradoxes under control.

##Unique Features

Era-Switching Mechanic: Players can instantly jump between two versions of the same location (e.g., medieval castle vs. ruined futuristic outpost) to solve puzzles and reveal secrets.

Paradox Choices: Decisions made in the past affect gameplay in the future (e.g., saving a village in 1200 AD means a thriving city in 2200 AD).

Dynamic Combat: Weapons and skills adapt depending on the timeline (swords in medieval, plasma rifles in futuristic).

Replayability: Multiple endings based on paradoxes resolved or created.

##Target Audience

Teens and young adults (13–30) who enjoy story-driven adventures, time-travel mechanics, and action-puzzle hybrids. Fans of Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, or Life Is Strange will find appeal here.

##Art Style & Theme

A stylized semi-realistic art style with vibrant colors in historical settings and sleek neon designs in futuristic timelines. The tone balances epic adventure with thought-provoking “butterfly effect” storytelling.

##Inspiration

Inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Assassin’s Creed (for historical immersion), and Bioshock Infinite (for its time-bending narrative). The idea also draws from popular sci-fi films like Interstellar and Doctor Strange.

##Tools or Platforms

Planned for Unity (cross-platform), with releases on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. A simplified mobile spin-off could also be explored.
